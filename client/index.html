          Growing your own food geatly cuts down on carbon emissions compared to buying from the grocery store. To help home gardeners be more
          conscious of the environmental impact of food sourcing, ecoPlantly tracks and visualizes how much home gardeners are saving in carbon
          emissions with each vegetable they grow.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to bridge the gap between inexperienced gardeners and home gardening resources. Growing your food is truly accessible.
          ecoPlantly provides a beginner-friendly database of vegetables and herbs, complete with considerations for available space, climate,
          and materials. Trust us, anybody can garden if they really want to!

        <p>
          Food production alone accounts for one quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of food’s carbon footprint can be
          attributed to mass production emissions in factories and farms. Transport to grocery retailers is also a huge factor, with the average
          distance travelled by retail vegetables being 1500 miles.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Growing your own food reduces production resources consumed, organic and packaging waste, and food miles travelled, all of which are
          significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. If households could replace just 20% of store-bought food with self-grown food,
          they could reduce their carbon footprint by 68 pounds of CO2e a year!
